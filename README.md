*Description: Data Pipeline Development*

This project focuses on building an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to handle raw data, clean it, transform it into a usable format, and store it for analysis. Using Python, the pipeline integrates Pandas for data handling and Scikit-learn for preprocessing and transformation.

Extract Phase:
The pipeline begins by loading raw data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. This allows easy handling of structured datasets, enabling quick access to rows, columns, and data types.

Transform Phase:
The transformation stage prepares the data for machine learning or analytics tasks. It includes:

Handling missing values (e.g., replacing with mean or most frequent values).

Scaling numerical features to ensure consistent value ranges.

Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Combining all steps using Scikit-learnâ€™s Pipeline and ColumnTransformer to ensure modularity and reusability.

Load Phase:
The final stage stores the processed dataset in a clean format (CSV). The transformed data can be used directly for machine learning models or business intelligence applications.

Advantages:

Automates repetitive preprocessing tasks.

Ensures consistent and clean datasets for analytics.

Modular and scalable design for future enhancements.

This pipeline serves as a reusable, efficient solution for handling raw data and preparing it for further analysis or model training.
